# Purpose
This app intends to bridge the gap between Tabroom.com (Speech/Debate tabulation software) and the Zoom web-conferencing platform.

# Background
Currently, one of the most common ways to run an online, live speech/debate tournament is using Zoom.  This involves creating a Zoom session and then assigning competitors to smaller [breakout rooms](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206476093-Enabling-breakout-rooms).  However, as of today (8/12/2020), there is no way to automatically assign people to these breakout rooms.  Instead, tournament staff monitoring the event would have to manually sort participants into rooms.  This can be a lot of work, especially because rooms could contain up to 100 competitors and judges to be sorted into up to 30 rooms.

Thankfully, this app takes care of that problem.  It functions as a translator from Tabroom-file-language to Zoom-file-language.  This way, tournament staff can upload a couple of files at the beginning of tournament and leave Zoom do the gruntwork, rather than having to do it by hand.

# Setup



# How to Use (in progress)

1. As a tournament director, the first thing to do is to register using the Register page
2. Next, upload the tournament table (this contains all of the events and their abbreviations)
3. Next, upload the full list of judges
4. Next, upload the list of entries in all events
5. To cross-check, match the entries with the corresponding emails

Now, the tournament is completely set up.

During each round, all you do is upload the pairing, and the program will give you a file to upload into Zoom.
Right before you begin the Zoom session, upload that file into "Preset Breakout Rooms"
Right before the round begins, click "Assign Breakout Rooms" and everything works!
